# Assignment-3.2R

The code contains three functions: cheat(), remind_me() and make_art.
cheat() takes a numbers 1, 2 or 3 as arguments and returns the solution for the respective exercise from Assignment 3.1.
It directly plots the solution and provides the code in the console. 

remind_me() takes no arguments and simply prints my most common groceries that I do not want to forget into the console.

make_art() takes a optional numeric argument to set a seed. It uses the ggplot and patchwork packeges to show a random art work.
If a seed is set in the funciton, the artwork can be reproduced.
